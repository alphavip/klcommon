defvar is similar to defparameter, which establish name as a dynamic variable.

    (defvar *var-name*)
    (defvar *var-name* 1)

Note: the character '*' is a part of the symbol:
    
    (values *var-name*)

We can use (load "filename") in clisp to load a lisp code file, and then we can
call these functions defined in that file.

#

Unlike macro in C, macro in Lisp is much more like a function:


    (defmacro as (tag content)
        `(format t "<~(~A~)>~A</~(~A~)>"
                   ',tag ,content ',tag))

Here, we can use 'as' (as center "String").
