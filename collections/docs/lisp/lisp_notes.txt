Chapter 2

Note all the operators in Common Lisp are functions, but most are.

One operator that doesn't follow the Common Lisp evaluation rule is quote.The
quote operator takes a single argument, and just return it verbatim.
For convenience, Common Lisp defines ' as an abbreviation for quote.

Two Lisp data types that we don't commonly find in other languages are symbols
and lists. Symbols are words. Ordinarily they are converted to uppercase.

Lists are represented as zero or more elements enclosed in parenthese.

In Common Lisp, there are two ways of representing the empty list. You can
represent it as a pair of parentheses with nothing between them, or you can use
the symbol nil.

In Common Lisp, the symbol t is the default representation for truth(me:boolean
 true). Falsity in Common Lisp is represented by nil, the empty list.

A function whose return value is intended to be interpreted as truth or falsity
is called a predicate. Common Lisp predicates often have names that end with p.

The simplest conditional in Common Lisp is if:
    (if (listp '(a b c)) (+ 1 2) (+ 5 6))

Although t is the default representation for truth, everything except nil also
counts as true in a logical context.

You can define new functions with defun. It usually takes three or more
arguments: a name, a list of parameters, and one or more expressions that will
make up the body of the function.
