FIGURE OUT WHAT A SYMBOL IS
===========================

<ANSI Common Lisp>
------------------

One potentially confusing thing about Lisp is that symbols are related to
variables in two very different ways. 

When a symbol is the name of a special variable(global variable), the value
of the variable is stored in a field within the symbol. The symbol-value 
function refers to that field.

Pakcages are symbol-tables, mapping names to symbols.

Functions and variables have symbols as their names.

Symbols are real objects, and not just names. (it contains many fields like:
 name, value, plist.)

Symbols are created implicitly when we type their names.

You can get the name of a symbol by calling symbol-name.

<Successful Lisp>
-----------------

A Lisp symbol most commonly names a value or -- when used as the first element
of a function call form -- a function.

What's unusual about Lisp is that a symbol can have a value as a function and a
variable at the same time.

Lisp decides which of these values to use based on where the symbol appears.
When the evaluation rule requires a value, Lisp looks for the variable value of
the symbol. When a function is called for, Lisp looks for the symbol's function.


Summarize
----------

    (setq first 'val) ; first is a cons related function actually
    (first '(a b c)) => a
    (symbol-function 'first) => retrieve the function field of symbol first
    (symbol-value 'first) => VAL, retrieve the value field of symbol first
    (symbol-function first) => first, evaluate first => val, second, apply 
                            symbol-funciton on val

    (symbol-name 'first) => retrieve the print name field of symbol first

    (type-of first) => retrieve the type of the value of symbol first.
    (type-of 'first) => retrieve the first self type, of course it's a symbol


    (defun testfn () ()) 
    =>
    What this actually do is to define a symbol, and set the function field of
    the symbol 'testfn to this new function. So:

    (symbol-function 'testfn) => will get this function
    (symbol-value 'testfn) => no value right now


In conclusion, i suppose there is NOT variable and function theory in Lisp, only
symbol. And variable and function is a field of a symbol, which is actually a
real object.
