Condition Handling in the Lisp Language Family
==============================================

The Common Lisp community typically prefers to speak about its condition system
rather than its error system to emphasize that there are not just fatal but also
not-fatal situations in which the capabilities provided by this system are
useful.

A situation that is represented within the language is refered to in Common Lisp
as a condition, an object of class CONDITION is used to represent such a
situation.

With the language the class CONDITION is a superclass of another class ERROR,
 which represents situations that would be fatal if not appropriately managed.
