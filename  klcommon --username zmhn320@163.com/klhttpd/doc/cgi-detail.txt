Brief : write the detail implementing the cgi

As you know, the cgi query string is a key-value string separated by '&'.The
query string is in the uri or in the quest body when using POST method.

What i should do first is to parse the query string, make a list which element
is a key-value pair.Also, i should decode the query string because there are 
some special character like '+' and '%'.

I found a bug in klhttpd, when the request uri contain some special character,
(yes, it will contain like '%20'), the server cannot find the resource.So i should
decode the uri either when handling static resources.

When receive a http request, the server should check the request type, if it's a cgi
query, then the server should call cgi handler. Otherwise send the static resources.

How can i detect a request is a cgi query ? First, if the method is GET but if the uri
contain '?', then it's a cgi query; Second, if the type is POST, then it must be a cgi
query.
